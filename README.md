# Animations

Animations showing the evolution of three wave functions under different measurement and feedback conditions, namely without measurement or feedback (black), with measurement but no feedback (red), and with both measurement and feedback (blue). The solid lines represent the probability distribution of momentum measurements, while the dashed lines indicate the corresponding potential energy due to feedback.
